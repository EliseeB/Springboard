Branching Exercise

Part I



- What git command creates a branch?

    git branch name_of_branch



- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?

    Fast-forward merge: Merging a branch directly into another branch without new commits.

    Recursive-merge: Combining seperate changes from multiple branches, creating a merge commit.



- What git command changes to another branch?

    git checkout name_of_branch_Iam_switching_to



- What git command deletes a branch?

    git branch -d name_of_branch
                or
    git branch -D name_of_branch    **to force delete



- How do merge conflicts happen?

    Merge conflicts occur when different changes are made to the same file or when branches have divergent versions. A manual resolution is required to combine and decide on the desired changes.
