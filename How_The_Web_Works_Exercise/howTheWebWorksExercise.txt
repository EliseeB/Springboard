        POST for sending data to a server

    Request from a client to a server (using HTTP protocol)


- What is an HTTP response?

    Response from the server to a client using HTTP protocol.

- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?

        When you type a URL in a browser, it finds the correct web server for the site, sends a request for the page, receives the page's content, and then displays it. This involves steps like translating the URL into an IP address, establishing a connection, sending a request, processing the request on the server, receiving the response, rendering the content, and displaying the final web page for you to see.
